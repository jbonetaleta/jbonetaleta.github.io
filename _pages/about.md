I'm a chemist currently working at the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, UK, in [Prof. Gonçalo Bernades group](https://gbernardeslab.com). My research consist on 'uncoventional' drugs based on catalysts to develop novel cancer therapeutics, combining metals and molecules within living systems. 

I conducted my Ph.D. at the University of Zaragoza, Spain under the guidance of Prof. Santamaría and Dr. Hueso in the [Nanostructured Films and Particles group](https://nfp.unizar.es) from 2019 to 2023. My research was centered on designing nanostructured catalysts activated by the chemistry of the tumor microenvironment. However, my interests extended beyond simply determining whether the catalyst could eliminate cancer cells. We also delved into understanding the catalytic mechanisms driving these processes, which finally led us to discover new artificial reactions within cells not previously considered.

Part of my Ph.D. was carried out at the University of California, Berkeley in [Prof. Christopher J. Chang group](https://changlabucb.wordpress.com). Here, I utilized chemical probes to investigate the impact of nanoparticle treatments on cellular metal levels, aiming to uncover new vulnerabilities.
